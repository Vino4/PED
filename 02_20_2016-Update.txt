2/20/2016 Progress Update:
	We have met last night to work on motor balancing and auto-starting the control sketch on power up.
	Unfortunately, our efforts to auto-run the sketch as soon as the Arduino is powered have failed.
	However, we managed to balance three out of four motors.
	A video demonstrating the balancing process:

	We are on track to meet tomorrow night to finish balancing the motors and start balancing the propellers as well as reattempt to autoboot the sketch if time permits.
Since this is our first update, we'll also include previous updates here:
	We have met twice a week since week 5, we've also been constantly connecting through various methods including Slack platform, SMS, etc..
	We have accomplished the following:
		- Defined our plan and selected our parts
		- Acquired all the parts
		- Assimilated the drone
		- Soldered the wire connections from the ESCs to the motors
		- Soldered the wire connections from the battery to all the ESCs and the Arduino board
		- Calibrated the ESCs
		- Completed the software to control all motors through Serial connection
