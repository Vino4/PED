2/21/2016 Progress Update:
	During our meeting tonight we managed to balance the final motor as well as fix the auto-boot problem that we had during our last meeting (02/19).
	We also spent a few hours learning about UDP packets, Edison's WiFi, TouchOSC, OSCuino.
	And finally, we managed to get our phones to communicate with the arduino through touchOSC, OSCuino and wiFi.
	We managed to get OSCuino working with the WiFi library by modyfing the OSCData file in the original library.
	We also managed to get the size of the packets sent from the phone to the Arduino, however, we are having problem with parsing the packet into the actual interface data.
	We will attempt to fix this problem on our freetime and hopefully by the time for our meeting this Wednesday.
	*Note: We decided to push back the prop balancing as the ability to operate the drone with our phones is more critical to our progress at this point.
